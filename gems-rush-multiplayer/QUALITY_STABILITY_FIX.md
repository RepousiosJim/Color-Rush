# Quality Stability Fix - Gems Rush: Divine Teams

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Quality level was automatically changing from "high" to "ultra" and back during gameplay, causing visual inconsistency and potential performance fluctuations.

## Root Cause
The performance optimization system was designed to automatically adjust quality based on real-time frame rate monitoring. While this was intended to provide optimal performance, it caused unwanted quality fluctuations during stable gameplay.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Performance Optimization Hook
- Added quality locking mechanism to prevent automatic changes
- Implemented wider hysteresis thresholds to reduce oscillation
- Added longer stabilization periods (5 seconds instead of 2)
- Added more conservative quality change requirements
- Added user control over auto-quality behavior

### 2. Quality Lock During Gameplay
- Game interface now locks quality to "high" during gameplay for stability
- Users can still access quality controls through settings
- Performance indicator shows lock status (ðŸ”’ for locked, ðŸ”„ for auto)

### 3. Enhanced Settings Interface
Added comprehensive Performance Settings section with:
- **Quality Level**: Manual quality selection (Minimal to Ultra)
- **Auto Quality Adjustment**: Toggle for automatic quality changes
- **Enable Visual Effects**: Control visual effects independently
- **Enable Animations**: Control animations independently  
- **Max Visual Effects**: Limit simultaneous effects (2-50)
- **Frame Rate Target**: Set target FPS (30-120)
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Toggle GPU acceleration

### 4. User Tips and Guidance
Added performance tips section in settings:
- Disable "Auto Quality" to prevent fluctuations
- Use "High" quality for best balance
- Lower "Max Visual Effects" if experiencing lag
- Enable "Hardware Acceleration" for smooth animations

## Files Modified
1. `src/hooks/usePerformanceOptimization.ts` - Enhanced stability and user controls
2. `src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx` - Quality locking during gameplay
3. `src/components/ui/SettingsModal.tsx` - Performance settings interface
4. `src/types/settings.ts` - Added performance setting types
5. `src/lib/settings/constants.ts` - Default performance settings

## Benefits
- âœ… Stable visual quality during gameplay
- âœ… User control over performance preferences
- âœ… Better performance on lower-end devices
- âœ… Professional gaming experience
- âœ… Clear performance feedback to users

## Usage
- Quality is automatically locked during gameplay for stability
- Users can modify quality preferences in Settings > Performance
- Development mode shows quality status with lock indicator
- Auto-quality can be re-enabled for users who prefer adaptive performance

## Default Settings
- Quality Level: "High" (locked during gameplay)
- Auto Quality: Disabled (for stability)
- Visual Effects: Enabled
- Animations: Enabled
- Max Effects: 15
- Target FPS: 60
- Hardware Acceleration: Enabled

This fix ensures a smooth, professional gaming experience while giving users full control over their performance preferences.
