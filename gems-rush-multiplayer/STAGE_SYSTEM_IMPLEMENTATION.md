# 🎮 Stage System Implementation Guide
## Comprehensive 20-Level Stage System with Obstacle Blocks

### 📋 **Implementation Summary**

I've successfully implemented a complete stage system for Gems Rush Divine Teams with the following major features:

---

## 🏆 **Stage System Features**

### **20 Unique Stages**
- **Regular Stages**: 1-4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-19
- **Boss Stages**: 5 (Forest Guardian), 10 (Ocean Leviathan), 15 (Mountain Titan), 20 (Divine Emperor)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Easy → Medium → Hard → Boss
- **Themed Environments**: Forest, Ocean, Mountain, Volcano, Divine

### **Stage Completion Requirements**
- ✅ **Target Score**: Must reach minimum score threshold
- ✅ **Blocks Destroyed**: Must destroy required number of obstacle blocks
- ✅ **Move Limit**: Must complete within maximum moves allowed

### **Star Rating System**
- ⭐ **1 Star**: Basic completion (reach target score, destroy blocks, within moves)
- ⭐ **2 Stars**: Exceed score target by 50%
- ⭐ **3 Stars**: Exceed score target by 50% AND use ≤70% of allowed moves

## 🟢🔵 **Obstacle Block System**

### **Green Blocks** 🟢
- **Health**: 1 HP (destroyed in one hit)
- **Appearance**: Starting Stage 3
- **Spawn Pattern**: Horizontal or vertical lines (3-5 blocks)
- **Visual**: Green gradient with damage indicators

### **Blue Blocks** 🔵
- **Health**: 2 HP (requires two adjacent gem matches to destroy)
- **Appearance**: Starting Stage 4
- **Spawn Pattern**: Horizontal or vertical lines (3-5 blocks)
- **Visual**: Blue gradient with health bar and damage effects

### **Destruction Mechanics**
- Blocks are destroyed when **adjacent gems are matched**
- Each match reduces block health by 1
- Destroyed blocks count toward stage completion
- Visual effects show damage and destruction

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Files Created/Modified**

#### **New Files**
1. `src/lib/game/StageSystem.ts` - Stage generation and management
2. `src/lib/game/ObstacleBlockManager.ts` - Block spawning and destruction
3. `src/components/ui/ObstacleBlock.tsx` - Block visual component
4. `src/components/ui/StageSelectScreen.tsx` - Stage selection interface

#### **Modified Files**
1. `src/types/game.ts` - Added ObstacleBlock types and GameState properties
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Integrated stage system and block destruction logic
3. `src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx` - Added block rendering and stage stats

### **Data Flow**
```
Stage Selection → Stage Generation → Obstacle Spawn → Game Play → Block Destruction → Win Condition Check → Reward Distribution
```

## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **Accessing Stage Mode**
1. From main menu, select "Stage" mode
2. Stage selection screen shows all 20 stages
3. Only unlocked stages are playable
4. Boss stages highlighted with special indicators

### **Playing Stages**
1. Match gems adjacent to obstacle blocks to destroy them
2. Monitor stats: Score, Moves, Blocks Destroyed
3. Complete all objectives to win
4. Earn 1-3 stars based on performance

### **Stage Progression**
- Complete Stage 1 to unlock Stage 2
- Continue sequentially through all 20 stages
- Boss stages unlock after completing previous stages
- Track progress with star ratings

---

## 📊 **Reward System**

### **Stage Completion Rewards**
- **Coins**: 50 + (stage × 10), Boss stages ×3
- **Gems**: stage ÷ 3, Boss stages ×2
- **XP**: 100 + (stage × 25), Boss stages ×2
- **Stars**: 1-3 based on performance

### **Star Requirements**
- **1 Star**: Meet minimum requirements
- **2 Stars**: Score ≥ 150% of target
- **3 Stars**: Score ≥ 150% + moves ≤ 70% of limit

---

## 🔍 **Debug Features**

### **Development Tools**
- Visual block type indicators (G/B)
- Health display on multi-hit blocks
- Stage progress tracking in console
- Win condition test button

### **Console Output**
- Stage loading information
- Block destruction notifications
- Completion status and rewards
- Next stage unlock notifications

---

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

### **Planned Features**
- Additional block types (ice, stone, metal)
- Special objectives (collect gems, time limits)
- Power-up integration with blocks
- Leaderboards and competitions
- Daily stage challenges

### **Possible Improvements**
- Animated block destruction effects
- Sound effects for block destruction
- More complex block patterns
- Stage editor for custom levels

---

## 🎯 **Game Balance**

### **Difficulty Curve**
- **Stages 1-5**: Tutorial and easy introduction
- **Stages 6-12**: Medium difficulty with more blocks
- **Stages 13-20**: Hard challenges with complex layouts
- **Boss Stages**: Significant difficulty spikes with special mechanics

### **Block Spawning Algorithm**
- Avoid blocking essential gem positions
- Ensure solvable layouts
- Balance between challenge and fairness
- Progressive complexity increase
