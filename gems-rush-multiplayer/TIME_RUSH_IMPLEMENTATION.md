# Time Rush Mode - Implementation Guide

## Overview

**Time Rush Mode** is an enhanced, adrenaline-pumping variant of the classic match-3 gameplay specifically designed for high-intensity, time-limited gaming sessions. This implementation transforms the traditional experience into a fast-paced, visually dynamic challenge with unique scoring mechanics and clickable power-ups.

## Core Features

### 🕒 **60-Second Timer**
- Precisely 60 seconds of gameplay
- Visual timer with color-coded intensity levels
- Real-time countdown with enhanced typography
- Timer-based multiplier bonuses

### 🎨 **Dynamic Visual Experience**
- **Normal Mode (60-30s)**: Orange/red gradient background
- **Warning Mode (30-15s)**: Intensified orange/red with 1.5x scoring multiplier  
- **Adrenaline Mode (15-0s)**: Red/yellow gradient with 2.0x scoring multiplier
- **Critical Mode (10-0s)**: Pulsing red effects with maximum intensity

### ⚡ **Enhanced Scoring System**
```typescript
Base Scores (2x normal):
- 3-match: 100 points (vs 50 normal)
- 4-match: 300 points + Lightning power-up
- 5-match: 600 points + Rainbow power-up  
- 6-match: 1000 points + Bomb power-up
- 7+ match: 1500 points + Meteor power-up

Time Multipliers:
- Normal (60-30s): 1.0x
- Warning (30-15s): 1.5x  
- Adrenaline (15-0s): 2.0x

Combo Multipliers:
- Base: 0.5x per combo level
- Maximum: 5.0x total multiplier
```

```

### State Management

```typescript
interface TimeRushStats {
  finalScore: number
  totalMatches: number  
  powerUpsActivated: number
  maxCombo: number
  rushBonus: number
  timeUsed: number
}

interface PowerUpIndicator {
  id: string
  type: 'lightning' | 'rainbow' | 'bomb' | 'meteor'
  row: number
  col: number
  charge: number
  isReady: boolean
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
const calculateTimeRushScore = (matchSize: number, comboLevel: number, timeRemaining: number): number => {
  // Base scoring (2x normal)
  let baseScore = TIME_RUSH_SCORES[`${matchSize}_MATCH`] || 1500
  
  // Combo multiplier
  const comboMultiplier = Math.min(comboLevel * 0.5 + 1, 5.0)
  
  // Time-based rush multiplier
  const rushMultiplier = timeRemaining <= 15 ? 2.0 : timeRemaining <= 30 ? 1.5 : 1.0
  
  return Math.floor(baseScore * comboMultiplier * rushMultiplier)
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Animation Performance
- CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps
- Optimized particle systems with object pooling
- Efficient DOM updates with React batching

#### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of animation timers
- Power-up indicator garbage collection
- Event listener cleanup on unmount
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback/useMemo
