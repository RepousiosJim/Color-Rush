# This file would contain an actual PNG image
# For now, I'll create a placeholder that should be replaced with a real 1200x630 image
# In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Create a proper 1200x630 pixel image showcasing the game
# 2. Include game screenshots, logos, and promotional content
# 3. Optimize for social media sharing

# Placeholder content - replace with actual image binary data
